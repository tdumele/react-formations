# Counter

## Intro

This is a simple project representing a counter application made with **React** and **Material UI**.

The interest of this project is to demonstrate that it is possible to create something in three different ways :
- Just using **React** ;
- With an implementation of Flux : **Redux** ;
- Or with **RxJS**.

## Process

Repository :

```
git clone -b react https://gitlab.com/MrDoomy/Counter.git
```

Dependencies :

```
yarn install
```

Launch :

```
yarn start
```

Enjoy =)
